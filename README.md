I've learned how to define functions using 'def', which allows me to organize my code into reusable blocks. I also learned to use 'try' and 'except' to handle errors, ensuring my program doesn't crash when something unexpected happens. Lastly, I used while loops to repeat actions until a certain condition is met.
